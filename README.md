# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### Purpouse

This application serves as an interactive biography of my life, showcasing various aspects and milestones in a dynamic and engaging format. It is designed with several key components to display detailed information about me, including my background, achievements, hobbies, and interests.

One of the standout features of this application is the implementation of drag-and-drop functionality, allowing users to interact with the content in a more intuitive and personalized manner. Additionally, there is an xample on using forms with validation and conditional rendering to show certain components.

The primary purpose of this project is to demonstrate my proficiency in developing applications using the React library. Through this application, I highlight my ability to utilize React for creating interactive user interfaces and managing application state efficiently.

Moreover, this project showcases my skills in DOM manipulation, where I leverage the Document Object Model to create dynamic and responsive elements on the web page. To complement these features, I have employed advanced CSS techniques to ensure the application is not only functional but also visually appealing and user-friendly.

A notable aspect of the application is the integration of the React Context API. This API is used to manage global state across various components, demonstrating my ability to handle complex state management scenarios in a scalable and maintainable manner.

In summary, this biography application is a comprehensive demonstration of my capabilities in web development, particularly with React. It combines interactive elements, user input forms, DOM manipulation, advanced CSS, and state management using the React Context API to provide a holistic view of my skills and experiences as a developer.
